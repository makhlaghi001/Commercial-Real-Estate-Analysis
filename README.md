## Project Proposal 

Our team has chosen to work on a financial analysis model, focusing on the 
commercial real estate market, particularly Office Buildings. Our main areas 
of focus will include the golden horseshoe area in Ontario. The region and 
cities that we will be comparing is Toronto, ON as it is a strong real estate candidate. 

Our analysis will generate historical and current data comparison, so that we 
can have a much better understanding and to identify the growth trends 
within the market, and as well as which KPI (Key Performance Indicators) 
have substantial role in those trends. To analyze the growth in further depth,
we will provide visualization on all Key Performance Indicators which 
constitutes the market analysis. 

In addition to understand the patterns and volatility of the CRE office building
market, we will directly compare the office real estate sales/investment 
market to Canadian annual interest rates, from 2012-2022. Thus, providing 
us with a correlation model, which can represent, if a direct correlation exists
between the two. 

Lastly, we will provide an analysis, to show weather or not there is a 
correlation between the annual interest rate, REIT stocks, property 
sales/investment and new development. 

As for some of the questions that we will be asking from our analysis will be:
Identify the max and min in office building sales within the last 10 years
Identify and visualize the inventory of office buildings with the following, as well as what years we saw increase and decrease in inventory:
Existing
Under construction
Construction starts
Demolitions and deliverables -Identify Vacancy rates and occupancy rates, through the ten years. Has it been consistent or not? In what years did the market experience a downturn and up turn.
Identify and visualize sales volume by location, types of transactions, types of buyers and sellers, who are the big players and what percentage of the market they occupy? Has this been consistent through out the 10 years?
Identify and calculate interest rates for the past 10 years. Is there a relationship between interest rate and sales volume? If so, provide examples within the data (annual sales, year, and the driving force)
Identify two major Canadian REITs, visualize their ten-year stock growth, to find out if there are any correlation exists between REIT stock growth and CRE market.
Identify and showcase the net absorption. Has the demand increased or decreased over the years?
Does Toronto have experience strong growth in inventory, sales volume, rental market increase, occupancy rate, new construction and under construction? What are some of the driving factors of the growth?
Identify the down turns and up turn in each market and specify the driving force for such results.
What are the property's areaâ€™s major economic drivers? Who are the major tenants or corporations? What is the average rate of return on investment (and is that trending upward or downward)?
For our project, we will obtain some of our data regarding the commercial real estate market from COSTAR.com. We will obtain our historical annual interest rate from 2012-2022 via bank of Canada.
As per the data regarding stock on REITS, we will generate a 10-year data stock history for particular REITS from reitreport.ca.
